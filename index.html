		<p>Sharks are fascinating marine creatures. They play an important role in the ecosystem as apex predators, for they are able to maintain its stability. Let's learn more about sharks!</p>

		<h2>An Introduction to Sharks</h2><br>
	
		<p>Sharks are fishes that have inhabited the Earth for over 400 million years. They are commonly found in all seas to depths of 6,600 feet. They are characterized by their <mark>fusiform body shape and cartilaginous skeleton</mark>, which is a soft and flexible connective tissue. Sharks are <mark>ectothermic</mark> or cold-blooded. Sharks have <mark>several rows of teeth</mark>, with the upper teeth designed to kill and eat prey due to their triangular shape.</p>

		<h2>Shark Behavior</h2><br>
	
		<p>Most sharks prefer to be <mark>active and hunt their prey at night</mark>. Their feeding behavior is dependent on <mark>the availability of prey and amount of competition</mark>. Because hunting activities are very tiring, large predatory sharks <mark>do not need to feed everyday</mark>. However, smaller shark species eat a couple of times during the day.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<p>Their relationships with other sharks are mostly based on their species. Some species are <mark>solitary; they prefer to navigate the waters and hunt prey alone</mark>, but they make an exception during the mating period. On the other hand, other species <mark>form groups called “schools”</mark>, which are segregated according to their size.</p>

		<h2>Attacks</h2><br>
	
		<p>Sharks often show <mark>strong responses to stimuli like odour from an injured prey</mark>. Most shark attack incidents often occur when <mark>sharks mistake humans for their natural prey</mark>, since they are of similar size. There are also cases when sharks grow curious and try to investigate any splashing or <mark>aggressive activity on the surface of the water.</mark></p>
		
		<br>
		
		<p>Contrary to common belief, sharks are actually more afraid of humans than we are of them. There are <mark>less than 100 shark attack cases every year</mark>, with less than 20 of them resulting in death.</p>

		<h2>Threats</h2><br>

		<p>Sharks are most affected by harmful human activities. This includes:</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Overfishing - removal of a species of fish at a rate that causes it to be underpopulated</li>
			<li>Bycatch -fish caught unintentionally while trying to catch another type of fish</li>
			<li>Shark Fin Demand - shark fins have high monetary and cultural value, they are often an ingredient used in shar fin soup</li>
		</ul>
